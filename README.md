# Plant-Disease-Detection-using-CNN-and-Image-Processing

             Plant disease are detected using Image Processing. Here initially the images of the affected leaves are captured  or selected and compared with the data set. It uses the CNN algorithm to find the disease. After  detecting users are directed to an e-commerce website  where suitable medicine can be purchased . Major purpose of this application is to support green house farming  and gardening which is considered to be the future farming methodology.
Makes use of image processing
Detects the disease of apple tree only
It  use CNN VGGNet MODEL
With 96.6% accuracy

PROPOSED SYSTEM:

I have used 28 layer custom convolution  neural network .Plant village dataset is used which consist of 54,309 healthy and unhealthy plant leaf images
Nearly 31 diseases like
